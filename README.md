# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to use pivot tables and graphs in Excel to vizualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date. I will also visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Over all, the most popular and successful campaign category is theater. Out of 1,369 theater campaigns, 61% were successful, 36% failed, and 3% were canceled. Campigns held in May were the most successful, while December was the least succesful month to start campaigns. From April to May, there is a spike in successful campaigns that tapers off by the end of the year. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As campagin goals increase, success decrease and failures increase. However, this trend is obscured by a spike between goals ranging from $35,000 and $44,999.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were a few challenges and limitations in this analysis. It's not clear why there aren't any records of canceled campaigns in the month of October and why there's a spike in failed campaigns following a slightly lower number of failed campaigns. 

## Results
Two conclusions that can be drawn are (1) May is the best month to launch a campaign and (2) campaigns started in December have a high likelihood of failing. What we can conclude about Outcomes based on Goals is that campaigns have a greater chance of succeeding when they are less than $5000. Some limitations to this dataset stem from a poor sample size, not enough variables included in the analysis such as backers_count, deadlines, and country of campaign. Some graphs we could create are: graphs that include outcomes based on launch date and deadlines and outcomes based on goals and launch date. Another possible graph could be goals, pledges, and backers_count. Lastly, we could create a graph that looked at outcomes based on country of campaign.
